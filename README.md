## INTRODUCTION
I’m part of the data analysis team at Mabb Clothing, a global e-commerce company. Our recent analysis focuses on identifying trends from 2019 to 2023 and comparing them to the current year, 2024. We examined sales, inventory, product performance, customer behavior, and website metrics to gain insights into overall business performance.

Using SQL for data extraction and joining, followed by data cleaning in Python, we visualized our findings in Tableau. The analysis concludes with a Python-based “what-if” model, aimed at optimizing costs and refining pricing strategies.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The company (MABB Clothing ) lacks visibility into key metrics such as website activity, customer demographics, product performance, and inventory status, limiting effective decision-making. A comprehensive data-driven analysis is needed to provide insights and guide improvements in user experience, marketing, inventory management, and profitability.
## OBJECTIVES 
	1.	Analyze website activity to improve user experience.
	2.	Examine customer demographics for targeted marketing.
	3.	Assess product performance to identify best/worst sellers.
	4.	Evaluate inventory and distribution for stock and supply chain efficiency.
	5.	Present data-driven insights with actionable recommendations.
	6.	Conduct a “what-if” analysis on profit margins to enhance profitability.

 ## CONCLUSION 
 In conclusion, my analysis at Mabb Clothing revealed essential insights into website performance, customer behavior, and product sales. I identified key traffic areas and sources to enhance the user experience, while also highlighting customer segments for targeted marketing. Additionally, I addressed top-selling and underperforming products, along with stock and distribution inefficiencies. The predictive “what-if” analysis offered actionable strategies for optimizing pricing and costs, enabling data-driven decisions to improve profitability and overall business performance.

 ## RECOMMENDATIONS

	1.	Optimize key website areas to improve user experience and engagement.
	2.	Use demographic insights for targeted marketing to key customer segments.
	3.	Promote top-selling products and address underperformers to maximize sales.
	4.	Resolve stock availability issues and improve distribution efficiency.
	5.	Implement pricing strategies to enhance profit margins.
	6.	Continuously monitor performance data for ongoing improvements.
